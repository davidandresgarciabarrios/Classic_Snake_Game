# 🐍 Snake Game

Welcome to the **Snake Game**! This is a classic implementation of the beloved Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls or its own tail. Have fun and see how high you can score!

## 🎮 Features

- **Modular Design**: Clean and organized code with separate classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard.
- **Smooth Controls**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake with responsive and intuitive controls.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Randomly generated food positions and increasing snake length keep the game challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you collect food. The game ends with a 'Game Over' message upon collision.
